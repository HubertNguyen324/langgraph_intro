# An Introduction to LangGraph
Learning the basics of LangGraph through a LangChain Academy course

## Introduction

Welcome to LangChain Academy! 
This is a growing set of modules focused on foundational concepts within the LangChain ecosystem. 
Module 0 is basic setup and Modules 1 - 4 focus on LangGraph, progressively adding more advanced themes. 
In each module folder, you'll see a set of notebooks. A LangChain Academy accompanies each notebook 
to guide you through the topic. Each module also has a `studio` subdirectory, with a set of relevant 
graphs that we will explore using the LangGraph API and Studio.
